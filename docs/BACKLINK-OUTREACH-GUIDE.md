# Backlink outreach guide – Tabletop Re-Boxing

Getting other websites to link to **https://tabletopreboxing.shop** helps Google rank you higher. You can’t automate this; it’s done by reaching out to real people. Use this guide and the templates below.

---

## 1. Who to contact

- **Indian board game / tabletop groups** (Facebook, Discord, Reddit r/boardgames, r/IndianGaming) – ask if they have a “where to buy” or “local sellers” page and if they can add you.
- **Board game cafes or stores in India** – suggest a “partners” or “accessories we recommend” section and offer to reciprocate if you ever list partners.
- **Board game bloggers or YouTubers (India or global)** – after a review or unboxing, suggest adding a link to your site in the description for “where to get inserts/organizers”.
- **BoardGameGeek (BGG)** – add your site in your profile, in relevant forum threads when someone asks “where to buy inserts in India”, or in list/geeklist descriptions.
- **Directory / “best of” lists** – search for “board game inserts India”, “tabletop accessories India”, “board game storage” and contact the site owner to suggest adding Tabletop Re-Boxing.

Hi [Name],

I run Tabletop Re-Boxing (https://tabletopreboxing.shop) – we sell 3D-printed board game inserts, organizers, dice towers, and travel boxes in India.

## 3. What to send (BGG forum post – when someone asks where to buy)

When someone asks “where can I get inserts in India?” or similar:

> You can check out Tabletop Re-Boxing: https://tabletopreboxing.shop – we make 3D-printed inserts, organizers, and travel boxes in India. If your game isn’t listed, you can request a custom order.

Keep it helpful, not spammy. Only post when the thread is actually asking for recommendations.

---

## 4. Pages worth sharing when asking for links

- **Homepage:** https://tabletopreboxing.shop  
- **About (who you are, India, how you make inserts):** https://tabletopreboxing.shop/about  
- **Care guide (useful, link-worthy content):** https://tabletopreboxing.shop/guide  

When you ask for a link, you can say: “You can link to our homepage, or to our About page / Insert care guide if that fits your content better.”

---

## 5. What to avoid

- Don’t buy links from “link building” services or link farms – Google can penalize that.
- Don’t spam the same message in many places – personalize each request.
- Don’t promise payment for a link unless you’re doing a clear, disclosed sponsorship.

## 6. Track what you did

Keep a simple list: date, site/person contacted, link sent (yes/no). Recheck after a few weeks to see if the link is live. One good link from a relevant site can matter more than many weak ones.
